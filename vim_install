# Create the directories you need
sudo mkdir -p /opt/local/bin

# Download, compile, and install the latest Vim
hg clone https://code.google.com/p/vim/
cd vim

sudo make install

# Add the binary to your path, ahead of /usr/bin
echo 'PATH=/opt/local/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bash_profile

# Reload bash_profile so the changes take effect in this window
source ~/.bash_profile

#Voila! Now when we use vim we will be using the old one. But, to get back to our old configuration in the event of huge f*ckups, we can just delete the /opt directory.
