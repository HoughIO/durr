vim *.cpp		Start Vim, defining the argument list to
			contain all the C++ files.  You are now in the
			first file.
qq			Start recording into the q register
:%s/\<GetResp\>/GetAnswer/g
			Do the replacements in the first file.
:wnext			Write this file and move to the next one.
q			Stop recording.
@q			Execute the q register.  This will replay the
			substitution and ":wnext".  You can verify
			that this doesn't produce an error message.
999@q 			Execute the q register on the remaining files.
